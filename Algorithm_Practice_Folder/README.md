# Code Disclaimer
The sorting functions used in the files of this folder were taken from the various sorting algorithm pages on geeksforgeeks.org.
The purpose of these files are mainly to improve my understanding of sorting algorithms and the command line interface tool in python.
While I did not code the sorting algorithms myself, everything else in these files were of my own design.
