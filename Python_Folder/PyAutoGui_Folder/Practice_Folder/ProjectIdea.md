Project Idea for using and learning more about pyautogui module:

Write a program to store passwords in some sort of database similar to the video on Kalle's YT channel:

To-Do List:
-Write new file with classes and functions that produce Interpreter-like environment to serve as a "database"
-Code commands like "add", "new pword", and "quit" for Interpreter through helper function
-Maintain Interpreter through while loop of some sort that only terminates once the user types in "quit"
-Import PwordGen python file as a module to facilitate making random passwords
-Use pyautogui to try and sign up/log in to websites that would use password in this database
